# Modelling-and-Simulation-Course-Labs
This repository contains all the lab materials for the course Modelling and Simulations. We focus mainly on developing compartment models to computationally model complex phenomenon like the drug dosage problem(Labs 1,2,3). The next main topic is SIR(Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) modelling with different variations(Labs 4,5,6). In the last part we explore random walks and cellular automaton to model phenomenons like heat transfer and SIR modelling(Labs 7,8,9).
